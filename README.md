# Stock-Price-Prediction-Model

In this Model, I have used dataset of stock prices of 2 months to learn a model
and predict the stock prices for the next week.

The Model works perfectly for short term traders.

The required python models are-
1. pandas
2. math
3. numpy
4. scikit-learn
5. keras
6. matplotlib

The model fits through Long Short-Term Memory RNN and used adam for optimization. As an activation function ReLu is used. A sample graph of actual price and predicted price is shown below.
